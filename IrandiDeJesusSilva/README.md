# Verilog Modules Repository

This repository contains a collection of Verilog files designed for various digital logic projects. It serves as a resource for learning, experimenting, and implementing hardware designs using Verilog, a hardware description language widely used in digital system design.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Provide reusable Verilog modules for common digital circuits.
- Share example projects to help others learn Verilog and digital design principles.
- Offer testbenches for simulation and validation of hardware designs.

## Features

- Basic combinational and sequential logic circuits.
- Example designs for ALUs, flip-flops, multiplexers, and more.
- Well-organized file structure for easy navigation.
- Testbenches to validate each design's functionality.
- Compatibility with popular simulation tools (e.g., ModelSim, Quartus, Xilinx Vivado).
